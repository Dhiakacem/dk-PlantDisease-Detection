# dk-PlantDisease-Detection
This project detects plant diseases using machine learning in Python. It features a Flask web app for uploading leaf images and receiving real-time disease predictions. The models, primarily CNNs, are trained with Kaggle datasets on Google Colab, combining powerful tools for an efficient plant disease detection solution.
